CSS Flexbox is a module layout that makes it easier to create flexible responsive layout structures without applying floats or positioning. It allows for more efficient horizontal and vertical alignment and distribution of items within a container.

This CSS_FLEX project repository will demonstrate how to use a CSS flexbox, added or inline, inside an HTML document using the "style" attribute.
